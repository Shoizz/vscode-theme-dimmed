## What is dimmed syntax

![dimmed-animation](images/dimmed-animation.gif)

Some elements of the code that can add visual noise are colored less bright than context meaningful parts because additional colors add additional cognitive work to process it. With dimmed syntax, just two shades of gray are used + one additional shade for comments.
