# Dimmed

Dimmed theme is a experimental dimming syntax color scheme and minimal theme for VSCode

## Features

* Decreasing cognitive load by minimizing colors usage to highlight a code syntax

* Additional distractions minimization with minimal theme

* Contrast but eye-friendly

* Most popular languages are supported: Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Go, C, C++, Java, Python

## What is dimmed syntax

Some elements of the code that can add visual noise are colored less brighter than context meaningfull parts of the code, because additional colors adds additional cognitive work to process it. With dimmed syntax just four shades of gray are used.
