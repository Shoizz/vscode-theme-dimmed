## What is dimmed syntax

![dimmed-animation](images/dimmed-animation.gif)

Some elements of the code that can add visual noise are colored less bright than context meaningful parts because additional colors add additional cognitive work to process it. With dimmed syntax, just two shades of gray are used + one additional shade for comments and unused instances.

## Features

* Decreasing cognitive load by minimizing colors usage to highlight a code syntax

* Additional distractions minimization with minimal theme

* Contrast but eye-friendly

* Supported: Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Go, C, C++, Java, Python (probably some other languages as well)
